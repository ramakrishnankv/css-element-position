      <h1>Positioning a html element using CSS</h1>
      <article>
        <p>
          Positioning methods for an element is specified by position property in CSS. Here are some example use cases
          using position property. Possible five values for position proerty are;
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li type="disc">static</li>
          <li type="disc">relative</li>
          <li type="disc">absolute</li>
          <li type="disc">fixed</li>
          <li type="disc">sticky</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Properties left, top, right and bottom decides the position of the element. "z-index" property allows the
          element
          to stack over the another.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Static: </strong>By default every elements are positioned static. The element's position will be
          accroding to the normal content flow. Static value can use at any stage when position to be
          overrided to default. Properties left, top, right and bottom are not affected by
          static positioned element.

          <a href="javascript:void(0);" id="link1">This is Link 1</a>
          <div id="link1-d" class="staticItem">
            This is a static positioned element, clicking the above link this will changed to absolute positioned
            element. Try!
          </div>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Relative: </strong>An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position.
          Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a relatively-positioned element will cause it to be
          adjusted away
          from its normal position. Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Absolute: </strong>Is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned
          relative to the viewport, like fixed).

          However; if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors, it uses the document body, and moves
          along with
          page scrolling.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Fixed: </strong>Is positioned relative to the viewport, which means
          it always remains in the same place
          even if the page is scrolled. The top, right, bottom, and left properties are used to position the element.

          A fixed element does not leave a gap in the page where it would normally have been located.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Sticky: </strong>is positioned based on the user's scroll position.

          A sticky element toggles between relative and fixed, depending on the scroll position. It is positioned
          relative until a
          given offset position is met in the viewport - then it "sticks" in place (like position:fixed).
